<h2 id="overview"> üîé 1. Overview </h2>
Understanding the choices made by machine learning models is essential for building trust and promoting real-world adoption. Shapley values have emerged as a principled and widely-used method for feature attribution. By considering all feature subsets, Shapley values offer comprehensive and fair explanations for model predictions.

However, computing exact Shapley values is computationally intractable (NP-hard), prompting the development of various approximation techniques. The abundance of such methods introduces a new challenge: **Which technique should practitioners trust?**

This work fills that gap through a **systematic and large-scale evaluation** of 17 Shapley value approximation algorithms across:
- üíØ **100 tabular datasets** from diverse domains
- üß† **6 model architectures**

We analyze two core aspects:
- **Replacement Strategies** for handling missing features
- **Tractable Estimation Strategies** to approximate Shapley values efficiently

Our results reveal critical trade-offs in accuracy, compute time, and robustness. This benchmark provides the foundation for selecting the right method and encourages further research in interpretable machine learning.

### ‚úÖ Prerequisites
You will need:
- `git`
- `conda` (Anaconda or Miniconda)

### üì¶ Installation

**Step 1:** Clone this repository using `git` and change into its root directory.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/TheDatumOrg/ShapleyValuesEval.git
```

**Step 2:** Create and activate a `conda` environment named `shapeval`.

```bash
conda env create --file environment.yml
conda activate shapeval
```

<h2 id="evaluation"> üìä 3. Evaluation </h2>

We decompose the evaluation into **two principal dimensions**:

### üß© Replacement Strategies

These strategies define how to handle **missing features** in the Shapley framework. We compare 8 different strategies using an **exhaustive sampling** baseline for accuracy, enabling deep insights into their strengths and limitations.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Tractable Estimation Strategies

To address the computational burden, we evaluate **17 different estimation methods** that trade off fidelity for efficiency.

Each method is benchmarked using **100 datasets** and **6 types of predictive models**. The evaluation pipeline includes accuracy metrics, compute-time analysis, and critical difference diagrams to highlight statistically significant performance differences.
